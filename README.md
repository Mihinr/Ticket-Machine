# Ticket Printing Machine

The Ticket Machine is a simulation of a ticketing system modeled using FSP (Finite State Process) and implemented in Java with concurrency features. The system consists of a shared ticket machine used by passengers and serviced by two technicians, ensuring smooth operation in a multi-user environment. This project models various states of the machine and applies concurrency to manage multiple processes simultaneously.

### Tech Stack: Java, FSP, Concurrency.

# Features:

- 🎫 Shared Ticket Machine: The ticket machine is shared by multiple passengers, allowing them to purchase tickets in an orderly manner.

- 👨‍🔧👩‍🔧Technician Service: Two technicians service the ticket machine, ensuring it’s always ready for passengers.

- 🔄 Finite State Modeling: Utilizes FSP to model the different states of the ticket machine (e.g., idle, busy, serviced).

- ⚙️ Concurrency Management: Implements concurrency features to handle multiple passengers and technicians interacting with the system simultaneously without conflicts.

- 💻 Java Implementation: Built in Java, ensuring high performance and thread management in a multi-threaded environment.
